<p align="center">
Sano is a financial technology software developer turned game developer and designer. He made his first game a text adventure game called <a href="https://gist.github.com/Sanokei/7b7ab7a44d288a67756139b36e9a40da">Adventure Quest</a> in 2015 at the age of 13 and had been into the world of gaming ever since. Studying software development, entrepreneurship, and financial technology in high school he felt unfullfilled with the path he had choose. In a bold move he moved away from fin-tech and delve into the world of game development once more starting in college, starting Sideways Turtle in June 2020 in the progress, originally named Yawning Productions.
